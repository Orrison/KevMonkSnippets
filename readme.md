This is a repository of snippets created by Kevin Ullyott for use in Ekklesia360/MonkDev systems

MonkCMS is a CMS designed from the ground up by Monk Development, Inc. Content goes in via the MonkCMS web application and goes out via getContent() API calls embedded within site templates.

Instead of having to build a website around a CMS, developers look to MonkCMS for simple content integration, staying true to their design goals from start to finish.

For complete API documentation, see http://developers.monkcms.com/.
