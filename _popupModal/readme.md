# Popup Modal

This creates a popup box where ever it is called that displays content found in a section with the name of "Popup Modal Section"

**This will only work on sites that have Colorbox Installed**

The description of the section must have the string "on" in order to display

1. Put modal.js in your js file then call it in to what ever template you need it in

2. Place modal.php in a folder like _inc or _components (depending on the sites file structure) and update the link on line 4 of modal.js to reflect

3. CSS styling will most likely need to happen to make the embeded section look good. All the sections content is surrounded by a #popupModal ID that can be used in styling
