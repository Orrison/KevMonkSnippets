# Popup Modal

This creates a popup box where ever it is called that displays info found in a section with the name of "Popup Modal Section"

The description of the section must have the string "on" in order to display

Put modal.js in your js file then call it in to what ever template you need it in

Place modal.php in a folder like _inc or _components (depending on the sites file structure) and update the link on line 4 of modal.js to reflect

CSS styling will most likely need to happen to make the embeded section look good. All the sections content is surrounded by a #popupModal ID that can be used in styling

Enjoy!
